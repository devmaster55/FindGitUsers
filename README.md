### Requirements

For this asessment you'll need to familiarize yourself with parts of the GitHub REST API. The required features we'd like to see built are:

  1. A search bar that enables us to fetch GitHub user profiles by username:
     - If no user exists with the username provided, present a "Not found" view
     - If the user exists, present a view with that user's:

       a. Avatar
       
       b. Username
       
       c. Name
      
       d. Description
       
       e. Follower count, i.e. X followers
       
       f. Following count, i.e. X following
  2. A view which displays a list of the user's followers, as well as a view for who they're following
     - We should be able to navigate to this view by tapping on the follower/following counts
     - If a user in this list is tapped, it should navigate us to their profile view
  3. The ability to navigate backwards through the navigation stack
